## c64_kernal module

It provides access to Kernal routines, so it requires the Kernal ROM to be enabled.

TODO

## c64_basic module

The `c64_basic` module provides access to Kernal routines, so it requires the Basic ROM to be enabled.
In particular, this means that it will not work on cartridge targets without extra preparations.

#### `void read_joy2()`

Reads the joystick from the port 2.

#### `void read_joy1()`

Reads the joystick from the port 1.

#### `void read_also_joy2()`

Reads the joystick from the port 2 and adds its readouts to the current readouts.

#### `void read_also_joy1()`

Reads the joystick from the port 1 and adds its readouts to the current readouts.
