# Commodore 64-oriented modules

## c64_kernal module

The `c64_kernal` module is imported automatically on the C64 target.
It provides access to Kernal routines, so it requires the Kernal ROM to be enabled.

TODO

## c64_basic module

The `c64_basic` module provides access to Basic routines, so it requires the Basic ROM to be enabled.
In particular, this means that it will not work on cartridge targets without extra preparations.

#### `void read_joy2()`

Reads the joystick from the port 2.

#### `void read_joy1()`

Reads the joystick from the port 1.

#### `void read_also_joy2()`

Reads the joystick from the port 2 and adds its readouts to the current readouts.

#### `void read_also_joy1()`

Reads the joystick from the port 1 and adds its readouts to the current readouts.

## c64_joy2_default

Defines the joystick in port 2 as the default joystick.

#### `alias read_joy = read_joy2`
