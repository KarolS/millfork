# Command-line options

## General options

* `--version` – Display the version number and quit.

* `--help` – Displays help the command line option.

* `--` – End of the options, all the following parameters will be treated as input files, even if they look like options.

## I/O options

*  `-o <file>` – Output filename, without extension.
Extension will be added automatically,
`.prg` for Commodore (including LUnix/LNG),
`.crt` for Commodore cartridges,
`.xex` for Atari computers,
`.a2` for Apple,
`.dsk` for PC-88 disk images,
`.tap` for ZX-Spectrum tape images,
`.rom` for MSX cartridge images,
`.com` for CP/M executables,
`.nes` for NES/Famicom,
`.bin` for Atari 2600,
no extension for BBC micro program file,
`.inf` for BBC Micro file metadata,
`.asm` for assembly output,
`.lbl`, `.nl`, `.fns`, or `.sym` for label file.
Default: If compiling one file with `.mfk` extension, the same name as the input file. Otherwise, `a`.


* `-s` – Generate also the assembly output. It is not compatible with any assembler, but it serves purely informational purpose. The file has the same nam as the output file, and the extension is `.asm`.

* `-g` – Generate also the label file. The label file contains labels with their addresses, with duplicates removed.
It can be loaded into the monitor of the emulator for debugging purposes.
The file has the same name as the output file.
The extension and the file format are platform-dependent. 

* `-G <format>` – The same as `-g`, but with the specified format:

    * `-G vice` – format compatible with the Vice emulator. The extension is `.lbl`.
    
    * `-G nesasm` – format used by the NESASM assembler. The extension is `.fns`.
    
    * `-G sym` – format used by the WLA DX assembler. The extension is `.sym`.
    
    * `-G fceux` – multi-file format used by the FCEUX emulator. The extension is `.nl`.

* `-fbreakpoints`, `-fno-breakpoints` – 
Whether the compiler should use the `breakpoint` macro.
When enabled, breakpoints become memory barriers and the label file will contain the breakpoints if the format supports them.
Currently, the only formats that supports breakpoints are `vice` and `sym`.
`.ini` equivalent: `breakpoints`. Default: yes.

* `-I  <dir>;<dir>` – The include directories.
Those directories are searched for modules and platform definitions.
When searching for modules, the directory containing the file currently being compiled is also searched.
When searching for platform definitions, the current working directory is also searched.
If not given, the compiler will try to detect the default include directory.
If given, then the compiler will NOT try to detect the default include directory, and you will have to add it to the list yourself.

* `-i <dir>` – Add a directory to the include directories.
Unlike `-I`, this does not replace the default include directory and allows using directories with semicolons in their names. 
 
* `-t <platform>` – Target platform. It is loaded from an `.ini` file found in any of the include directories. See also [this document](target-platforms.md).

* `-r <program>` – Run given program after successful compilation.
Useful for automatically launching emulators without any external scripting.
The program is run with the working directory set to its own directory,
and it's passed the full path to the output file as its argument.

* `-R <param>` – Adds a parameter to the command line of the program run with `-r`. All `-R` options are added in order, before the output file name.

* `-D <feature>=<value>` – Defines a feature value for the preprocessor.

* `-finput_intel_syntax`, `-finput_zilog_syntax` –
Choose syntax for assembly sources on 8080-like targets.
Can be overridden by the source file itself using `#pragma`.
`.ini` equivalent: `input_intel_syntax`. Default: Intel (true) on Intel 8080/8085, Zilog (false) otherwise.

* `-foutput_intel_syntax`, `-foutput_zilog_syntax` –
Choose syntax for assembly output on 8080-like targets.
`.ini` equivalent: `output_intel_syntax`. Default: Intel (true) on Intel 8080/8085, Zilog (false) otherwise.

* `--syntax=intel`, `--syntax=zilog` – sets both previous options at once

* `-fline-numbers`, `-fno-line-numbers` – Whether should show source line numbers in assembly output. Slightly slows down the compilation. Default: false.

* `-fsource-in-asm`, `-fno-source-in-asm` – Whether should show the original source in assembly output. Implies `-fline-numbers`. Default: false.

## Verbosity options

 * `-q` – Suppress all messages except for errors.

* `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv` – Increase verbosity, various levels.
