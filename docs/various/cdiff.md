# Differences from C

## Syntax

* Block comments `/* */` are not supported, use line comments `//`.

* You cannot put multiple statements on one line.  
Semicolons are allowed at the end of the line, but no code can follow them.

* There are no `++` or `--` operators. Use `+= 1` and `-= 1`.

* Pointer types are declared using the `pointer.` prefix, not `*` suffix. To dereference them, use `p[0]` instead of `*p`.

* There is no unary `&` operator.
Pointers to an object are acquired using the `.pointer` suffix.
Raw addresses are acquired using the `.addr` suffix.
The numeric values of the pointer and of the raw address may differ.

* Operator precedence works differently.
Bitwise and bit-shifting operators have the same precedence as arithmetic operators,
and mixing different operators with the same precedence is usually forbidden.
This prevents most ambiguities in bit-twiddling code, but requires care when porting code from or to C. 

* There is no `!` operator. The negation is expressed as the `not` function.

* The modulo operator is written `%%`. As with `/`, it's only defined for unsigned division. 

* The `for` loops are range-based. Arbitrary, C-like `for` loops are not supported.

* Variable declaration and initialization have to be separate.

* Integer literals starting with zero and containing just digits are decimal, not octal.
For octal literals, use the `0o` prefix.

* String literals are not null-terminated by default. Use the `z` suffix for null-terminated strings.  
Note: this is the opposite of what KickC does!
Keep this in mind when migrating KickC code to Millfork or the other way around.

* In `if`, `do/while`, `while` and `for` statements, parentheses are not required, but braces are.
The `else` branch also requires braces, unless the only statement in the `else` block is an `if` statement.

* There has to be a space between many operators and character literals,
as the parser may treat the apostrophe as a part of the operator.

## Preprocessor

* The preprocessor cannot expand symbols to something more complex than an identifier or a literal.

* The preprocessor cannot define symbols for use in other files.

* The closest to C's `#define` is `#use`.
Unlike `#define`, such definitions are not visible within the preprocessor.

* Directives like `#use` and `#pragma` affect the entire file, not just the code after the directive.

* The preprocessor cannot include files.

## Semantics

* There is no automatic integer promotion. An operation of two bytes will yield a byte. For example:

        byte a
        byte b
        word w
        w = a * b

    may yield unexpected results. To prevent this, cast at least one argument:
    
        w = word(a) * b

    This issue applies mostly to the `*` and `<<` operators.

* There is no padding in structs, except before fields whose type is a struct or a union with a non-trivial alignment.
