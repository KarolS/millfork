# Millfork

A middle-level programming language targeting 6502-based, 8080-based, Z80-based and 6809-based microcomputers. 

For binary releases, see: [https://github.com/KarolS/millfork/releases](https://github.com/KarolS/millfork/releases)
(latest: 0.3.22).  
For build instructions, see [Build instructions](./COMPILING.md).

## Features

* high performance, due to being designed and optimized for 8-bit microprocessors

* multiple targets:

    * Commodore 64 (the primary target)
    
    * Commodore 64 with SuperCPU (experimental, incomplete and very buggy)
    
    * other Commodore computers: C16, Plus/4, C128, PET, VIC-20 (stock or with RAM extensions)
    
    * other 6502-based machines: Famicom/NES, Atari Lynx, Atari 8-bit computers, BBC Micro, Apple II+/IIe/Enhanced IIe, Atari 2600 (experimental), Commander X16 (experimental)
    
    * Z80-based machines: ZX Spectrum 48k, NEC PC-88, Amstrad CPC, MSX, TRS-80 Model 1 and 3, Robotron Z1013
    
    * CP/M
    
    * Game Boy (experimental)
    
    * Tandy Color Computer (experimental)
    
    * MS-DOS (very experimental, via 8080-to-8086 translation)

* multiple supported target processors:

    * well supported: MOS 6502, Ricoh 2A03/2A07, WDC 65C02, Intel 8080, Intel 8085, Zilog Z80
    
    * reasonably well supported: Sharp LR35902, CSG 65CE02, Motorola 6809
    
    * partially supported: Hudson Soft HuC6280, WDC 65816, Intel 8086

* inline assembly

* simple macros

* pay only for what you use: not a single byte of memory is used unless for code or explicitly declared variables

* a simple memory model that avoids using the stack

* multi-pass whole-program optimizer (that will even optimize your hand-written assembly if you ask it to)

* support for multi-file programs (Commodore only) and banked cartridges
